# Programming in Rust Individual Studies

This project contains all the code that I have written for my Individual Studies course in which I am teaching myself the Rust programming language.

## Run Programs

To run the programs, you must have Docker and Python 3.* installed on your system. Once you have these installed, run the `run_programs.py` file, which will iterate through the projects, create a Dockerfile for each of them, build the container, run it, then close and remove the container afterwards. You can remove and generate Dockerfiles, build and run Docker containers for single, multiple, or all projects by using the appropriate flags as described by `run_programs.py -h`.
